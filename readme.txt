This plugin automatically posts content from RSS feeds to different blogs on your WordPress Multisite network, it’s like feedpress or wp-o-matic, except that it actually works, brilliantly and simply!

== Description ==

If you are looking for a plugin that automatically posts content from multiple different RSS feeds to specified blogs on a WordPress Multisite network, then you’re in the right place. You’ve probably struggled with alternatives like FeedWordPress, WP-o-Matic, Yaab autoblogger or even autoblogged…

And if you haven’t yet, then don’t worry, because we can tell you now that they don’t come close to Autoblog… which just plain works. No coding required, no complicated instructions, no worries! Now, copy and paste in your feed URL, give it a name of your choosing (for admin purposes) and select a blog that you want it to post to.  It’s that simple to set up, but you also have loads of options for customizing your feeds!

Of course, you can also use our Blog and User Creator or Batch blog and user creator to create hundreds, or even thousands of blogs, in a matter of minutes too! So, this plugin (plus our blog and user creation ones) essentially allows you to create a WordPress Multisite network, with thousands of blogs that are automatically published to by RSS feeds, within a few hours…. with no code knowledge required!

**Features and Options for Autoblog: **

- Choose if you want new posts to be published straight away, pending review or as drafts
- Select any author from your Multisite network
- Assign posts to categories and / or apply tags to them and / or import post tags with the post
- Filter posts that are included or excluded based on keywords or phrases
- Use excerpts (number of words configurable) or whole posts and choose what link (if any) you want to give to the original source
- Select how often you want Autoblog to check for posts
- Check out all the options in glorious technicolour below:

We’re also happy to add in new features on request – so just ask us in the forums and odds are we’ll put it in for you. And we should point out at the end that while there’s potential for misuse of this as a spam or splog tool, where people could automatically republish content without the authors permission, there’s a huge amount of legitimate uses that this plugin can and will be put to, we know because we’ve been frequently asked for this functionality from entirely legitimate WPMU DEV Premium members, which is why we developed it.
